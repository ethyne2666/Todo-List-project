# TodoList Web App

This is my first project using the React JavaScript framework. The TodoList web app allows users to manage their daily tasks effectively by adding and deleting todos with descriptions.

## Features
- **Add Todos:** Users can enter a title and a description for each todo item.
- **Delete Todos:** Remove completed or unwanted tasks by clicking the delete button.
- **Persistent Storage:** Todos are saved to local storage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
- **Routing:** The app has two main pages, **Home** and **About**, using **React Router** for seamless navigation.
- **Responsive Design:** The app layout is clean and adapts well to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **React JS:** Component-based architecture for building the UI.
- **React Router:** For navigation between the Home and About pages.
- **Bootstrap:** Styled components and responsive design.
- **Local Storage:** To save todos persistently on the client side.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todolist.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd todolist
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
